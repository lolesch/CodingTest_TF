> 	- [ ] recorded, 
> 	- [ ] saved and 
> 	- [ ] replayed at a later time. 
> - [x] Put the controls for this feature (Start/Stop Recording button, Recording name input field and Load and play recording button) at the top of the screen. 
> - [ ] To specify which recording should be started or loaded the user has to type in the name of the recording in an input field. 
> - [ ] After a recording has been started by clicking the start recording button, the start recording button should transform into a stop recording button. 
> - [ ] When the recording is stopped via the stop recording button, the recording gets saved.
> - [ ] If the user makes and saves a recording, they should be able to replay it even after restarting the application. 
> - [ ] When the recording is replayed the recorded actions should be performed in the same sequence and with the same speed. 
> - [ ] The recorded actions should include all button actions mentioned above. 
> - [ ] When starting and stopping a recording with a previously used name, saving it should just overwrite the save for the old recording with the same name.
